# We Use: Asymmetric Encryption with AntiVirus Scanning

DIMA Encryption Provides the Asymmetric Encryption with Virus/Spam Scanning features for all types of files.

Unlike symmetric encryption, here we use different keys for encryption and decryption. Asymmetrical encryption is also known as public key cryptography.

Secret keys are exchanged over the Internet or a large network. So in Symmetric encryption, if someone gets the secret key, he can decrypt the message. But asymmetric encryption ensures that malicious person do not misuse the key.

In asymmetric encryption, there are TWO key pair. - Public Key üîë and Private Key üîë

A file that is encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using it's private key.

# Features of DIMA Encryption
Increased security with Asymmetric Encryprion.<br>
The private keys do not ever need to be transmitted or revealed to anyone.<br>
Trusted Security with Antivirus scanning to predict Malicious Files.<br>

# Features of DIMA Antivirus Scanning üõ°Ô∏è
Every file gets scanned for malware/virus before encryption/decryption.<br>
DIMA uses World's most updated technology for AntiVirus Scan which quickly finds the malicious files.<br>
This helps us to intact security for all users as well as the server.<br>
Also by blocking infected files, we don't encourage the malicious files encryption and decryption.<br>

# How to Use

## Registration üë§
Once you successfully register, your personal key pair gets generated for encrytpion and decryption.<br>
We assure you both the keys and data safety, also we gurentee privacy and security of Data.<br>

## Encrypter üîí
Click on üîí Encrypter Option in Top Menu Bar.<br>
Upload the file to be encrypted (In case of Folder or Multiple Files Kindly first compress and then upload the compressed zip/tar file.<br>
Once Encrypt button is clicked, uploaded file gets through AntiVirus scan, If file is clean (No Malware/Virus found) then it will get encrypted with your own encryption key and will give you the encrypted file to download.<br>
If Malware/Virus detected in file then it will redirect you to the Malicoius file found page. Kindly note that, we don't accept infected file encryption to keep our security level intact.<br>
Encrypted files can be downloaded, stored or transmitted.<br>

## Decrypter üîì
Click on üîì Decrypter Option in Top Menu Bar.<br>
Upload the file, which is encrypted by you here, to be decrypted.<br>
Once Decrypt button is clicked, uploaded file gets through AntiVirus scan, If file is clean (No Malware/Virus found) then it will get decrypted with your own decryption key and will give you the decrypted file to download.<br>
If Malware/Virus detected in file then it will redirect you to the Malicoius file found page. Kindly note that, we don't accept infected file decryption to keep our security level intact.<br>
Decrypted files can be downloaded, stored and transmitted.<br>

# Data/Privacy Protection with DIMA Encryption

We don't disclose user's keys (any key) anywhere.<br>
We don't store any file uploaded on this application. Once the encryption/decryption is done and you download the file, uploaded file gets deleted automatically.<br>
